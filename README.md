# NSP-Overcoming-Noise
A project aimed to overcome thermal noise generated by the heat of near sensor processing using a neural network trained on images with dark-current-induced noise.
This project is being carried out as an independent study which has started in the spring of 2022. 

First images will be captured using a FLIR BlackFly 3 Camera which has noise induced using a heat-gun. The safety of heating the camera will be ensured using python code which relies on the Spinnaker SDK from FLIR. This code will ensure the safety of the camera by ensuring the camera does not exceed 100Â°C. 

Next an object detection neural network will be implemented in Python using TensorFlow and trained on the RAW images from the camera.
