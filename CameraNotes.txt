Camera Notes

-Camera and software communicate well. 

-When heated the camera will get hot and get hotter even after the heat gun is pulled away. 
 i. 1-2°C, after the heat gun was removed. 

—Two Minutes of no power and no heat cooled the camera from 46°C down to 33°C, (-13°C). 

—Camera now can take photos on its own using Trigger.py from Spinnaker SDK and the heat safety script.
