Camera Notes

-Camera and software communicate well. 

-When heated the camera will get hot and get hotter even after the heat gun is pulled away. 
 i. 1-2°C, after the heat gun was removed. — Solved, I bought a fan. 

—Two Minutes of no power and no heat cooled the camera from 46°C down to 33°C, (-13°C). 

—Camera now can take photos on its own using Trigger.py from Spinnaker SDK and the heat safety script. 

—HeatSafety needs an auto exposure method of sorts, exposures are currently quite off from on another. This is a problem
